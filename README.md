Our MVP will include: 

      -usage of Scala to create a Spark application
      
      -At least 9 queries for the data (~3 per person in the group)
      
      -Implement usage of the US confirmed and deaths timeseries data 
      
      -Implementation of Tableau in order to provide visualization of at least 2 queries on the data sets. 
      
      -Data partitioning of the US confirmed and deaths timeseries data
      
      -(ETL) extract data from the given data sets and load into HDFS
      
      -Find at least one trend within the data that use. 
      
      -Create a jar for spark-submit. 
      
      -Use of Agile scrum methodology. 

The questions we would like to be able to answer are as follows:

     1: Top 5 most deadly cities 
     
     2: Top 5 least deadly cities
     
     3: Most and Least deadliest months 
     
     4: City to City comparison or city to state (how much said city makes up for the state's data) 
     
     5: What month had the highest rate of change for covid data?
     
     6: What was the average number of deaths for urban versus non urban areas?
     
     7: What was the average number of confirmed cases for urban versus non-urban areas?
     
     8: Do changes in non-urban area data show similar trends in urban areas as well? 
 

Our stretch goals will include:

      -some implementation of MapReduce
      
      -attempt to use a heat map to visualize some data from our queries 
      
      -load and use our data as parquet files instead of as CSVs
